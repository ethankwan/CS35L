7.Tried to gitk the Emacs repository's master branch, realized that I 
  needed to enable X11 Forwarding. So I reopened Putty with X11 enabled,
  setting the display application to XMing. Then these commands worked:
  $cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
  $gitk
  XMing launched, the description of the screenshot is in gitk-description.
