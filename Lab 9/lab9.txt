8. Learned how to use vc-revert(C-x v u) and diff-apply(C-c C-a)
9. Went to all files modified that do not end in .c and reverted 
   changed using 
   emacs [file]
   C-x v u
   C-x C-c
   
   Then for the .c files, I left the changes to the char consts, but 
   reverted all other changes. 
   emacs [src/file]
   C-x v = (opens diff buffer)
   Looked through hunks
   C-u C-c C-a (revert hunk on appropriate ones)
   C-x C-c 
   'y'
10. $ls src/*.c.rej
    src/diff3.c.rej  src/diff.c.rej
    Went through diff3.c and diff.c 
    emacs [file]
    C-s ` 
    Replace with '
11. Remove untracked files
    $git clean -f 
12. $git status

    Since I used lnxsrv06, I had to copy the patch into file 
    gets-patch.txt to removed function 'gets'

    These error messages were printed, but upon checking to see if my 
    changes to diff were saved:
    $diff . -
      diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
    The ` is correctly replaced with '.
    $diff --help
    All the ` are again replaced with '.

14. Copy modified src folder into diffutils-3.0-patch, reclone diffutils 
    into diffutils-orig. Going into original diffutils, I copied src 
    into diffutils-3.0. Then ran diff on the two source codes. 
    $cp -r src ../diffutils-3.0-patch
    $git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-orig
    $cd diffutils-orig
    $cp -r src ../diffutils-3.0 
    $cd ..
    $diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch 
     > quote-3.0-test.txt
