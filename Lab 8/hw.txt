Yes the network would still be secure, even if the other teams had been
observing all the bytes moving across the network. Because they do
not have access to our private keys, attackers would not be able to
complete the data decryption. 
If the attackers gained keyboard access AFTER our server/client setup, 
the server would still be secure. Unless they had access to our keystrokes
while we were setting up our key pairs, they would still be unable to 
decrypt our data. 
But, if they had USB access, they could easily access our .ssh directory 
and acquire the public/private key pair.

From my testing, gpg2--verify seems to be unable to determine ownership of 
data. It compares decrypted signature using public key, to another set of 
decrypted data. An invader could generate a signature using their own public
key. --verify then uses the new public key it's been given to decrypt 
the new signature, which will match despite the corruption.
