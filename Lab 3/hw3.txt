Homework 3

Q1.

The patch from Message #10 improves the performance of command ls.
If the option -A is added after -a, it makes sense that it should
overwrite.
time ./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls
.004s
time ./usr/src/ls
.001s
But in regards to time efficiency, the unpatched version is faster.

Q2.

Some problems that could be encountered with a new adoption of the
patched version of Coreutils is the fact that personnel could be
accustomed to the old version's syntax, or that the existing application is
reliant on outdated syntax.

Q3.

wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/randline.py
 - downloaded the python script randline
python randline.py /dev/null
 - call randline.py on empty file
Output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError
    if seq is empty 
The script tries to read from the file and index the elements. Because
seq is empty, it encounters the Index Error. 

Q4.

python3 randline.py /dev/null
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Python3 modified the way tuples are unpacked, so
(errno, strerror) results in error because it is treated as a tuple.
