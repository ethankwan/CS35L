Assignment 3

1. First I used wget to download the Coreutils 8.29 source code tarball.  
   I downloaded the signature and GNU keyring. 
   I verified them using
   --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
   in my directory. 

2. I created ~/coreutilsInstall using mkdir and decompressed coreutils. 
   I read through the INSTALL file and used pwd on ~/coreutilsInstall and added
   the absolute path as the prefix for configure. 
   ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/ethank/coreutilsInstall
      checks many conditions and lists yes or no 
   make - builds all the executable files for the patch
   make install - installs all the files into coreutilsInstall 

3. cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin 
   ./ls, bug is recreated

4. Return to the coreutils-8.29 directory,
   touch patch_file, copy the text from Message 10
   patch -p1 < patch_file 
   Hunk 1 succeeded
   Run make

Much fewer files compiled after applying the patch. Not as many leaving/enter
commands
The make all-recursive command looks through directories inside coreutils-8.29
to determine if any of the source files were altered after the patch. Changes
made to the gnulib-tests folder. Essentially only select files were recompiled
according to the patch's changes. Make install not used for patch so 
that the broken version is in coreutilsInstall/bin, while 
coreutils-8.29/src has the fixed version.

   Test:
   cd  ~/coreutilsInstall/bin 
   ls -a -A 
   .
   .. appear in output

   cd ~/coreutilsInstall/coreutils-8.29/src
   ls -a -A 
   . 
   .. do not appear in output 

   Bug Fixed!
