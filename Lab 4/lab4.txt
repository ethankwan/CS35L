Lab 4 

1. Transfered tarball into local directory and unpacked with 
   tar -xzvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz then cd into coreutils-with-bug
2. Used ./configure and make, after which receiving an error:
     "utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'"
3. patch -p0 < coreutils.diff 
   the patch command runs from the root directory of coreutils-withbug
   patching file lib/utimens.c
   patching file lib/utimens.h
   patching file src/copy.c
   patching file src/tee.c
   patching file src/touch.c
4. Created directory for new install, coreutils-with-bugInstall
   pwd = /u/cs/ugrad/ethank/Documents/CS35L/Lab4/coreutils-with-bugInstall
   ./configure --prefix="/u/cs/ugrad/ethank/Documents/CS35L/Lab4/
                         coreutils-with-bugInstall"
   make
   make install
5. It appears that the main change in utimens is that futimens
   is now renamed to coreutils_futimens, fixing the comile error.
6.
Reproduce bug:
tmp=$(mktemp -d)
cd $tmp
touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
touch now
sleep 1
touch now1
TZ=UTC0 ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab4/coreutils-with-bugInstall/bin/ls
   -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

Output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2019-02-08 01:18:52.526534433 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2019-02-08 01:18:46.033317276 +0000 now

The files should be ouput in order of newest to oldest
(top file should be newest) but the oldest file, made in 1918 is 
listed as the newest.

7. Entered directory coreutils-with-bug/src
   Opened ls.c with emacs, looked through structure and used
   gdb ls 
   (gdb)b sort_files
   (gdb)run -lt --full-time
  
   Stepping through the switch statements, sort_type is set to sort_time
   time_type set to time_mtime

   (gdb)p/x sort_reverse
   $1 = 0x0
   And sort_reverse is false.
   (gdb)p/s func
   $2 = (int (*)(V, V)) 0x4064b0 <compare_mtime> 
   function compare_mtime is being called, which then leads to a call to
   timespec_cmp(struct timespec a, struct timespec b) from timespec.h
   which is supposed to return negative if A< B, 0 if A==B, positive if A>B
   Upon examining int diff, it can be seen that there is a risk of overflow
   when a.tv_sec is subtracted by b.tv_sec. 

8.
   Exit gdb, copy timespec.h to my working directory from coreutils
   cp coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h timespec.h
   As the subtraction was creating a risk of overflow, I implemented a 
   direct comparison in the place of the integer subtraction, preventing
   signed overflow. 

9.
Created ChangeLog using C+x 4 a on modified version of timespec.h
2019-02-07  Ethan W Kwan  <ethank@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu>

        * timespec.h: Uses direct comparison instead of integer subtraction.
        If seconds are equivalent, return the difference of nanoseconds.
        This way, signed overflow is prevented.

10. Changed the filepath in lab4.diff from just timespec.h to lib/timespec.h
    Allowing us to patch from the coreutils-with-bug directory. 
    patch -p0 <lab4.diff 
    patching file lib/timespec.h
    make
    cd $tmp
    ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab4/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time
    wwi-armistice now now1
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2019-02-08 07:21:37.396019575 +0000 now1
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2019-02-08 07:21:31.968836345 +0000 now
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi
    -armistice
   After the new patch has been applied the files show up in the 
   correct order!

11. After reproducing wwi-armistice, now and now 1 in my local dir, 
   the results are:
    TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2054-12-17 17:28:16.000000000 +0000 
      wwi-armistice
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2019-02-08 07:32:22.023635000 +0000 now1
    -rw-r--r-- 1 ethank csugrad 0 2019-02-08 07:31:47.855516000 +0000 now
   The SEASnet NFS filesystem uses 32-bit timestamps, whereas the local
   file system uses 64-bit timestamps. As the 32-bit timestamps 
   are not signed, it struggles to interpret the older files since 
   they appear as negative.
